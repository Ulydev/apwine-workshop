### 1. Introduction

APWine Finance is a protocol for future yield tokenisation, enabling farmers to hedge their risk and traders to speculate on yield farming volatility.
It is a complex product with many powerful use cases on future yield. In this workshop, we'll be diving into how to build a fixed-rate yield strategy on top of the Protocol and AMM.
